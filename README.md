SnakeMazia
==========

A slightly different snake game application written in Scala using JMonkeyEngine3 RC2.

### (Mazia = Maze + Mania)


A snake game with more fun aspects. Has no level design but can be considered as a complete game. It supports customization through a property file.

This project is devoted to the open source community as an example of scala-maven-jmonkeyengine which was a tricky experience for me.

Compilation
-----------

Project supports maven, so you can easily obtain dependencies, compile and make a complete jar out of the project.


After checking the project out, cd to the directory and type 

```
mvn clean install
```

One big jar will be available in target folder.


Running
-------

To run the game type 

```
java -jar target/SnakeMazia-1.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar

```
